## 🏗️ Recommended Architecture: Hybrid Cloud Monolith

### Why Monolithic for SME Clients?
```typescript
interface SMEBenefits {
  operational: "1-2 developers can manage entire system";
  cost: "Lower complexity = lower operational overhead"; 
  deployment: "Single deployment unit with rollback capability";
  debugging: "Easier troubleshooting with unified logging";
  performance: "No inter-service network latency";
}
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### FERPA Compliance Requirements
```typescript
interface FERPACompliance {
  dataClassification: "Educational records = highest security tier";
  accessControl: "Role-based with audit logging";
  encryption: "AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit";
  retention: "Automated deletion per institutional policy";
  audit: "All student data access logged and monitored";
}
```

### Microsegmentation Strategy
```typescript
interface SecurityZones {
  public: {
    components: ["CDN", "WAF", "Load Balancer"];
    access: "Internet-facing with DDoS protection";
    data: "No sensitive information";
  };
  
  application: {
    components: ["Chat API", "Agent Router", "Cache"];
    access: "Private subnet, NAT gateway for outbound";
    data: "Session tokens, conversation context";
  };
  
  data: {
    components: ["Student DB", "Vector Store", "Audit Logs"];
    access: "Isolated network, VPN access only";
    data: "PII, educational records, system logs";
  };
}
```

## 📊 Performance & Scaling Targets

### SME University Benchmarks
```typescript
interface PerformanceTargets {
  responseTime: "<500ms 95th percentile";
  concurrent: "2,000-5,000 active sessions";
  throughput: "100-500 queries/minute peak";
  uptime: "99.9% SLA (8.76 hours downtime/year)";
  
  scaling: {
    freshman: "25% load increase (orientation weeks)";
    exams: "40% load increase (career planning periods)";
    graduation: "60% load increase (job search season)";
  };
}
```

### Auto-Scaling Strategy
```yaml
Triggers:
  - CPU > 70% for 5 minutes → Scale out
  - Memory > 80% for 3 minutes → Scale out  
  - Queue depth > 100 messages → Scale out
  - Response time > 1s → Scale out

Scaling:
  - Min instances: 2 (redundancy)
  - Max instances: 20 (cost control)
  - Scale-out: +2 instances per trigger
  - Scale-in: -1 instance every 10 minutes
```
