# Comprehensive Simulated Testing Framework

## üéØ Testing Philosophy: Honest Simulation

**DISCLAIMER**: These are **simulated accuracy metrics** based on designed test scenarios, not real user data. Numbers represent system performance under controlled conditions with realistic queries but acknowledge the limitations of testing without actual student interactions.

## üìä Our RAG System Architecture (What We're Testing)

### **Vector Database Content:**
1. **Rohan Patel** - Career switcher from India (Business Analytics, 485 visa pressure)
2. **Sandeep Shrestha** - Recent CS graduate from Nepal (Full-stack developer path)
3. **Visa/Course Guidance** - International student support and scheduling
4. **Cybersecurity Bootcamp** - 4-week intensive AWS/Azure program

### **Metadata Fields Used for Matching:**
- `tags`: ['career_changer', 'international_student', 'visa_485', etc.]
- `contentType`: 'career', 'tutorial', 'concept'
- `category`: 'career', 'skills', 'cultural'
- `careerPaths`: ['business-analyst', 'full-stack-developer', etc.]

### **5-Agent Routing System:**
1. **Booking Agent** - appointment/advisor queries
2. **Knowledge Agent** - career guidance
3. **Cultural Agent** - international/visa queries  
4. **Voice Agent** - communication/presentation
5. **Schedule Agent** - timeline/interview queries

const ragRelevanceTests = [
  // PERSONA MATCHING TESTS
  {
    query: "I'm from India struggling to find business analyst jobs",
    expectedPersona: "Rohan Patel",
    expectedTags: ["career_changer", "international_student", "business_analytics"],
    relevanceCategory: "high"
  },
  {
    query: "recent computer science graduate needs portfolio help",
    expectedPersona: "Sandeep Shrestha", 
    expectedTags: ["recent_graduate", "full_stack_developer", "portfolio"],
    relevanceCategory: "high"
  },
  {
    query: "cybersecurity bootcamp information",
    expectedContent: "Cybersecurity Course Information",
    expectedTags: ["cybersecurity", "bootcamp", "aws", "azure"],
    relevanceCategory: "high"
  },
  {
    query: "485 visa timeline and course scheduling",
    expectedContent: "International Student Support",
    expectedTags: ["visa_support", "course_scheduling"],
    relevanceCategory: "high"
  },
  
  // EDGE CASE RELEVANCE
  {
    query: "machine learning career advice",
    expectedPersona: "closest_match", // No perfect match in our data
    relevanceCategory: "medium"
  },
  {
    query: "accounting job search",
    expectedPersona: "fallback",
    relevanceCategory: "low"
  }
];
```

### **Test 3: Persona Matching Accuracy**

```javascript
const personaMatchingTests = [
  // COUNTRY-BASED MATCHING
  { query: "india career transition", expected: "Rohan Patel", similarity: ">85%" },
  { query: "nepal software developer", expected: "Sandeep Shrestha", similarity: ">85%" },
  
  // ROLE-BASED MATCHING
  { query: "business analyst pathway", expected: "Rohan Patel", similarity: ">80%" },
  { query: "full stack developer portfolio", expected: "Sandeep Shrestha", similarity: ">80%" },
  
  // SITUATION-BASED MATCHING

## üîç TESTING METHODOLOGY

### **How We Measure "Accuracy":**

1. **Agent Routing**: `(Correct Routes / Total Queries) √ó 100`
2. **Relevance**: Semantic similarity of returned content to query intent
3. **Persona Matching**: Contextual appropriateness of matched persona

### **Confidence Intervals:**
- All metrics include ¬±5-10% uncertainty
- Based on limited test data (not real user interactions)
- Results may vary with different query phrasings

### **Limitations Acknowledged:**
- ‚úÖ **Simulated queries** - not real student problems
- ‚úÖ **Limited persona data** - only 4 main knowledge items
- ‚úÖ **Keyword-based routing** - not advanced NLP
- ‚úÖ **No user feedback** - can't validate actual helpfulness
- ‚úÖ **Small test set** - 50-100 queries vs thousands needed for statistical significance

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS FOR VALIDATION

### **To Get Real Metrics:**
1. **User Feedback Loop** - "Was this helpful?" buttons
2. **A/B Testing** - Compare routing decisions
3. **Analytics Tracking** - Monitor user behavior patterns
4. **Continuous Learning** - Update routing based on usage data

### **For Production Deployment:**
1. Implement user satisfaction tracking
2. Monitor agent routing decisions
3. Collect persona matching feedback
4. Measure actual response times and cache hit rates

**SUMMARY**: Our simulated testing provides reasonable estimates of system performance while honestly acknowledging limitations. These metrics represent designed system capabilities under controlled conditions, not validated real-world accuracy.
