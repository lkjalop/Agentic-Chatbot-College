5. AI searches your knowledge base â†’ generates response â†’ speaks back
6. Conversation continues until user hangs up

2. **Update webhook URL** to production URL
3. **Test the orange button** on your live site
4. **Monitor logs** in Vercel dashboard

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Twilio not configured" Error**
- Check environment variables are set in Vercel
- Verify Account SID, Auth Token, and Phone Number are correct

**2. Calls Not Coming Through**
- Check webhook URL is correct in Twilio console
- Verify webhook URL is accessible (try visiting it in browser)
- Check phone number format includes country code (+1)

**3. AI Not Responding**
- Check vector database is populated with data
- Verify UPSTASH credentials are working
- Monitor API logs for search errors

**4. Speech Recognition Issues**
- Speak clearly and avoid background noise
- Check Twilio speech settings in webhook responses
- Test with simple questions first

### Debug Endpoints:
- `GET /api/voice/call` - Check Twilio configuration status
- Check Vercel function logs for detailed error messages

## ðŸ’° Twilio Costs

**Typical Usage Costs:**
- **Phone number**: ~$1/month
- **Voice calls**: ~$0.013/minute (US)
- **Speech-to-text**: ~$0.02/minute

3. **Add rate limiting** for call endpoint
4. **Phone number verification** (Twilio Verify API)
