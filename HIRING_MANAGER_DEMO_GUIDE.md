## ❓ ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **"How is this different from ChatGPT or other AI assistants?"**
**Answer**: "Specialized agents for educational contexts - visa support, appointment booking, career guidance. Plus voice integration and security scanning. ChatGPT is general purpose; this is purpose-built for international students."

### **"What about scalability and costs?"**
**Answer**: "Current architecture uses existing managed services. Scales horizontally with serverless functions. Cost roadmap shows $0 for demo, ~$100/month for production, ~$500-1000 for enterprise. Clear ROI through support automation."

### **"How do you handle security and compliance?"**
**Answer**: "Security-first design with PII detection, threat scanning, and audit logging. Foundation for GDPR, Privacy Act, FERPA compliance. Phase 1 implemented, roadmap for full enterprise compliance documented."

### **"What if students try to break it or input malicious content?"**
**Answer**: [Demonstrate] "Let me show you..." [Try SQL injection in chat/voice] "System blocks threats automatically while providing helpful guidance to legitimate users."

### **"How long would it take to deploy this for a real client?"**
**Answer**: "Current implementation ready for institutional demo immediately. Production deployment 2-3 weeks for enhanced security. Full enterprise compliance 8-12 weeks. Clear phases with defined timelines and costs."

### **"What makes you different from other developers?"**
**Answer**: "Honest engineering - I document what works vs what's planned. Security-first thinking. Business understanding - features driven by real user needs. Production awareness - built for reliability, not just demos."
